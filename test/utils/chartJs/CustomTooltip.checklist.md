## CustomTooltip Test Checklist


* Tooltip can lock when point is clicked
* Tooltip unlocks when point is clicked again 
* Clicking on another point when locked closes the tooltip and makes a new locked tooltip at the clicked point
* Clicking anywhere else on chart makes tooltip disappear
* When tooltip is locked: Tooltips for other points still show 
* When tooltip is locked: Links in tooltip work
* higherIsBetter correct
* run along datapoints, back and fourth quickly, to see if there are other problems
* Tooltip is positioned properly relative to point
* When withErrorBoundary covers the chart, Tooltip is still positioned properly

**TODO** - Make a page with some charts to make this debugging faster
